### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science and Engineering Student at the University of Connecticut concentrating on software design and development.
I am currently a student software developer at the Digital Experience Group here at UConn, where I'm working on a webapplication using Vue for one of our researchers. I've also interned at Hubbell, where I worked with a team of experienced engineers and utilized technologies such as Angular, C#/.NET, and Microsoft Azure.
