### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Quincy Miller,

I am a Computer Science and Engineering Student at the University of Connecticut concentrating on software design and development.
I am currently a student software developer at the Digital Experience Group here at UConn, where I'm working on a webapplication using Vue for one of our researchers. I've also interned at Hubbell https://www.hubbell.com/ for both Summer 2022 and Summer 2023. There, I worked with a team of experienced engineers on analytical software estimated to bring in $6,000,000,000 in annual revenue.
